<h1>Welcome to my GitHub!</h1>
    <p>I have no idea what im doing with GitHub, but i am trying my best!</p>

<h2>Why GitHub?</h2>
    <p>GitHub seems to be the most popular website among coders who want to put their minds together for a bigger purpose!</p>
<br>

<h3>Now lets talk about video games!</h3>
    <p>To me, a good game is something that keeps your attention while also keeping you wanting to explore on your own, and not need youtube to complete the game!</p>
